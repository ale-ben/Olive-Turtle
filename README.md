Olive Turtle is a project developed for the "Laboratory of Making" course (2022/2023) taught by Professor Renzo Davoli and Professor Federico Montori at the University of Bologna.

The project aims to implement a board capable of controlling a 12V LED strip with brightness control and environmental data acquisition.

Everything is controlled using Home Assistant, an open source software written in Python and released in 2013 under the Apache 2.0 license. It is a complete home automation system that can integreate with most existing IoT and home automation devices (mainly thanks to the huge user base) and be used to control and automate all the devices in your home, including custom made microcontroller boards.
